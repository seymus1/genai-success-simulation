# genai-success-simulation
Simulation-based study of GenAI perceptions in higher education using PRISMA-guided systematic review and Monte Carlo modeling.  
Tests inverse-variance weighted "Success Score" on Likert-scale data using Bessel-corrected variance estimates, revealing stronger predictive power of usability-related themes over affective or trust-based factors.
